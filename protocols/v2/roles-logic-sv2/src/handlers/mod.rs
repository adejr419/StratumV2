//! Handlers are divided per (sub)protocol and per downstream/upstream
//! Each (sup)protocol define an handler for both the upstream node and the downstream node
//! Handlers are trait called Parse[Downstream/Upstream][(sub)protocol] (eg. ParseDownstreamCommonMessages)
//!
//! When implemented an handler make avaiable a funtction called
//! handle_message_[(sub)protoco](..) (eg handle_message_common(..))
//!
//! The trait require the implementor to define one function for each message type that a role
//! defined by the (sub)protocl and the upstream/downstream state could receive.
//!
//! This funtcion will always take a mutable ref to self, a message payload and a message type and
//! a routing logic.
//! Using parsers in crate::parser the payload and message type are parsed in an actual Sv2
//! message.
//! Routing logic is used in order to select the correct downstream/upstream to which the message
//! must be realyied/sent
//! Routing logic is used to update the request id when needed.
//! After that the specific function for the message type (implemented by the implementor) is
//! called with the Sv2 message and the remote that must receive the message.
//!
//! A Result<SendTo_, Error> is returned and is duty of the implementor to send the message
