/// when selecting transactions for inclusion in a block (to not create an invalid, oversized block).
/// Thus, this message is used to indicate that some additional space in the block/coinbase
/// transaction be reserved for the pool’s use (while always assuming the pool will use the entirety
/// of available coinbase space).
/// The Job Negotiator MUST discover the maximum serialized size of the additional outputs which
/// will be added by the pool(s) it intends to use this work. It then MUST communicate the
/// maximum such size to the Template Provider via this message. The Template Provider MUST
/// NOT provide NewWork messages which would represent consensus-invalid blocks once this
/// additional size — along with a maximally-sized (100 byte) coinbase field — is added. Further,
/// the Template Provider MUST consider the maximum additional bytes required in the output
/// count variable-length integer in the coinbase transaction when complying with the size limits.
